# Hi, I'm [Elena Cai](http://elenacai.com).
In Chinese, it's **è”¡åœ†æ…§**\
I am a student at Minerva Schools at KGI. \
I major in CS and Business. \
I am from Beijing, China. \
I love design, photography, and dance.

*Only one is correct for the following statements, good luck guessing which one is correct.*
ðŸ˜€
- I learned Spanish for 1 week in high school, but I dropped the course after 1 week because I had a crush on a German guy and switched to German instead.
- As a designer, I love Adobe product. I mostly use Adobe Illustrator for design work, and I started it during high school, while working on a UI paper on home automation app design.
- I don't think my current English name fits my personality, and my current English name is given by one of my English teachers.

Here is my favorite piece of art. Oh, I took the photo btw.

Here is my favorite quote:
> Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. - Rob Siltanen
